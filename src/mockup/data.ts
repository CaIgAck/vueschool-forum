I thought this could be a nice way to get to know each other a little better, so I'll start!\n\nMy dog is a five month old Italian mastiff (Cane Corso). Since I got him from Barcelona I thought a Spanish name would be suitable, and I named him Don Jefe, or Jefe for short (which means \"boss man\").\n\nJefe is a cute, little beast who eats 1.5 kg raw meat every day. He love to fart, snore and play.\n\nHere's Jefe with his Instagram hat and sqeaky ball 🎉🎉🎉\n![Don Jefe](http://i.imgur.com/XCWzR6l.jpg)\n",

      text: "I got Ace from an old engraver way back in the days. It all started out when @Robin spotted him struggling in the water. We saved him and I tried to place an ad in the newspaper to locate his owner. \n\nAce loved the batmobile and joined us everywhere. He caught on to criminals immediately, so I realized that this was a trained and highly skilled dog. Since I placed the ad under my real name I became concerned that anyone would recognize him (he has a unique star-shaped spot on his forehead) and pull a connection between Bruce Wayne and Batman. Robin had a nice solution, he cut him a mask from our black cloth toolbag and made him a bat-symbol for his collar.\n\nWhile I tried to use Ace to locate his master a response from the ad revealed that John Wilker, who was missing at that time, had bought his trained dog because he lives alone and is away from home all day.\n\nI remember those days vividly. Ace helped out while we had him, he caught criminals and even helped Robin locate a missing child. Anyways, long story short! We reunited Wilker and Ace and he was kind enough to loan us Ace for a few missions the next three years, but when Wilker took a new job which required a lot of traveling he wanted me to take care of Ace for him.\n\nHere's a picture of me and my brave canine Ace:\n![](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/cc/3a/dc/cc3adc2e92f86e7482742478fcbe055a.jpg)\n",

This was the first compact crossover SUV;[1] it made its debut in Japan and Europe in 1994,[2] and in North America in 1995. The vehicle was designed for consumers wanting a vehicle that had most of the benefits of SUVs, such as increased cargo room, higher visibility, and the option of full-time four-wheel drive, along with the maneuverability and fuel economy of a compact car. Although not all RAV4s are four-wheel-drive, RAV4 stands for "Recreational Activity Vehicle: 4-wheel drive", because the aforementioned equipment is an option in select countries.\n\nIn most markets, the RAV4 is the only compact SUV or crossover available from Toyota. In other markets, it is the crossover counterpart of the Toyota FJ Cruiser.\n\nSince the 2006 third generation model, Toyota has offered both short- and long-wheelbase versions of the RAV4. Short-wheelbase versions are sold in Japan and Europe; long-wheelbase versions in Australia and North America. Toyota of Japan also sells the longer-wheelbase version as the Toyota Vanguard, at Toyopet Store locations. Japanese versions are sold at two different Toyota Japanese dealerships, called Toyota Corolla Store and Toyota NETZ Store.',

In the US, a 2.0-liter straight-four producing 89 kW (119 hp; 121 PS) was offered. Both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive were available, and the RAV4 could be had with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. It was named the 1997 Automobile of the Year by Automobile Magazine. In 1997 for the 1998 model year, the RAV4 was slightly restyled on the front and rear fascias, and a soft top three-door was made available. Power was increased slightly to 95 kW (127 hp; 129 PS). In June 1999, the two-door hardtop was dropped from the American lineup, leaving the five-door and soft top models. In Japan, the 2.0-liter 3S-GE BEAMS engine with 132 kW (177 hp; 179 PS) was also available.
